# Preface

Reproducibility of scientific experiments is vital in assessing the validity of the results.
A recent study [^1] shows that the results of differential gene expression analysis
on microarray data with custom chips can change as different versions of chip annotation become available, making such studies
not reproducible. Many leading journals now require the authors to demonstrate reproducibility of the study results
by sharing the data and source code underlying the experiment. Even when the data and source
code are provided the readers may fail to reproduce the results because of differences in
operating systems, computing environments and software/library dependencies. Recently, workflows
have been developed that utilise the existing technologies to create stable, easy to share 
computing environments or "digital archives" that would run all the analysis on an environment
similar to the one used by the authors at the time of generating the results. Examples
of such digital archives include "Reference Environments" proposed by Hurley et al. (2014)[^2],
and "Continuous Analysis" workflows proposed by Beaulieu-Jones et al. (2016).

This book presents a collection of tools and workflows that have been developed to reproduce 
results of scientific studies. There will be a focus on developing digital archives for 
the analysis done in R statistical programming language, however workflows can easily be adapted
to be used with other programming languages.

### About the cover

The cover of the book is a photo of "Shazdeh Garden" gateway, the ninth Iranian garden 
registered on the UNESCOâ€™s World Heritage List in Kerman province, Iran. What is peculiar 
about this garden is that it is located in a desert. The water resource for Shazdeh Garden 
is streams originating from adjacent mountains. The garden is a perfect example of resource
management. When I reflect on my research career since my undergraduate studies, I see myself
as that bare and dry land, that owes its thrive and prosper to her supervisor's trust and support.
Melissa Davis believed my potentials and capabilities and gave me the chance to discover them. 
"Shazde Garden" is, therefore, a nice metaphor for the prosperity of one's potentials that 
could be achieved by belief and support of their supervisors. I hope we see more such inspiring
supervisors in the research community.
